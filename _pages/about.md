#### About

<div class="medium">
I am a Ph.D. researcher in the Mechanics of Functional Materials group of <a href="https://www.mawi.tu-darmstadt.de/mfm/mechanics_of_functional_materials/index.en.jsp">Prof. Bai-Xiang Xu</a> at Technical University of Darmstadt, Germany. I received my Master's in Advance Computational Methods in Civil Engineering in 2021 from RWTH Aachen University, Germany. I also hold a B.Sc. in Civil Engineering from University of Engineering and Technology Lahore, Pakistan.

#### My research focus

<div class="medium">
My research focuses on the development and implementation of advanced finite element formulations within the framework of isogeometric analysis (IGA) for coupled chemo-mechanical problems. I work on finite-strain modeling of lattice-based Li-ion battery electrodes, with emphasis on diffusion-induced instabilities, optimal micro-architecture design, and multiphysics coupling.

I worked on numerical formulations for beam elements, solid-beam elements, and Kirchhoff rod finite element methods, along with custom IGA-based MATLAB implementations. My work also involves nonlinear continuum mechanics, stability analysis, and efficient numerical techniques for multiphysics simulation.
